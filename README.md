# BipedalWalker

This project was the second practical assignment completed as part of the Introduction to Intelligent and Autonomois Systems course. The focus of this work was to explore different Reinforcement Learning approaches to solve the BipedalWalker-v3 environment from Gymnasium. Some of the tested algorithms were the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and the SAC (Soft- Actor-Critic).
